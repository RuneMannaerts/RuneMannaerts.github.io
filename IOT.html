									<p>For the course IoT Advanced in the second year of the Cloud & Cybersecurity program, our group of five individuals was given the challenging task of developing a parking system. Our goal was to create a system with four parking spaces using advanced technologies.</p>
									<p>To begin with, we installed an ultrasonic sensor at the entrance of the parking lot, just before the closed barrier. This sensor detected the presence of a car and relayed this information to a specially designed display.</p>

									<p>The display was developed to show in real-time how many of the four parking spaces were still available. If all parking spaces were occupied, the barrier remained closed, and a prominent LED was activated to indicate that no space was available. As soon as a parking space became available, the barrier would open automatically.</p>
									<p>My main contribution to the project was working with the USB camera that captured the photo of the license plate of each car. I was responsible for setting up and programming the camera, ensuring that it accurately captured the license plates. This data was then analyzed to identify the license plate and enable us to track the parked cars and display information about their location and license plate on the display.</p>
									
									<p>In addition to my contributions with the USB camera, I also provided assistance with the implementation of the LDR sensors. Together with my team, we connected and programmed the four light sensors to accurately detect when a car was parked in a specific parking space. This information was crucial for determining the occupancy status of the parking spaces and ensuring that the display accurately reflected their availability. While the USB camera was my main area of focus, I actively supported my team members in integrating the LDR sensors into the overall system, ensuring seamless cooperation between the different components of our project.</p>
									<p>Overall, it was a challenging and rewarding project where we applied not only technical skills but also teamwork and collaboration. We are proud to have created a fully functioning parking system.</p>
