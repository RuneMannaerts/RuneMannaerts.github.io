										<h1>Night of the Entrepreneurial Student</h1>

									<p>During the Night of the Entrepreneurial Student hackathon, our team embarked on an exhilarating journey of ideation and innovation. As we gathered for brainstorming after an engaging team-building exercise, the creative energy in the room was palpable. Numerous ideas flooded our minds, but a few particularly resonated with us, capturing our attention and sparking our curiosity.</p>

									<h2>Concept 1</h2>
									<p>One concept that captivated our imagination was the idea of a large screen that would spring to life whenever someone approached it. Our vision was to develop a system that would not only recognize the individual but also leverage the wealth of data our company possessed about them. This personalized interaction would enable the screen to display essential messages or information tailored to the person, creating a truly engaging experience.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Concept 2</h2>
									<p>Another idea emerged after fruitful discussions with Netropolix's HR team. They shared their struggles in effectively reaching engineers who worked remotely or at client locations. In response, we conceptualized a device that could be installed in cars and would serve as a conduit for vital messages or project important meeting minutes. By providing real-time updates before the driver embarked on their journey, we aimed to ensure they were always up to date, regardless of their physical location.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>our idea: kohola</h2>
									<p>However, it was during a conversation with the HR team that we stumbled upon our most impactful idea. Netropolix prided itself on providing opportunities for people from all walks of life, including individuals with disabilities. Inspired by their commitment, we set out to enhance the functionality of a device used by an employee with a physical disability. Our goal was to make it more compact and incorporate several technological upgrades.</p>
									<p>The enhanced device would feature a colored light and a miniature speaker, enabling immediate notification of critical issues faced by our customers. For instance, a red light could signify a database outage, displaying the customer's name and, if available, the affected system. Likewise, an orange light would indicate a non-urgent incident, such as multiple reports of a phishing email in Company X, highlighting the email address: Koen Vonlommel@msm.be, and other relevant details.</p>
									<p>We enthusiastically pursued this idea, as it aligned with Netropolix's values and allowed us to empower employees with valuable insights to address customer needs promptly. By developing a compact and technologically advanced device, we aimed to revolutionize the way incidents were communicated within the organization, fostering a proactive and efficient approach to problem-solving.</p>
									<p>This innovative device seamlessly combined accessibility, technology, and real-time updates to assist businesses in tackling challenges efficiently. We are proud to announce that our idea secured us second place in the Night of the Entrepreneurial Student Hackathon, highlighting the potential impact of our solution in the ever-evolving landscape of entrepreneurship.</p>
