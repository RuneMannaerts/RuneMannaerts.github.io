									<p>On Thursday, December 9th, I participated in the online hackathon called 'hacktory online'.</p>
									<p><b>What happened before...</b></p>
									<p>Initially, I was allowed to sign up. There were a certain number of teams of 4 people that we could join. I had already agreed beforehand with whom I wanted to do the hackathon. We then registered as Group 11. At the beginning, we were given a task that we had to complete before December 6th at 23:59. We were allowed to make a video introducing our team members and showcasing our logo and name (System Zombies). We were also asked to mention the global issue we wanted to solve after Corona, and we chose energy shortage. Additionally, we received a schedule outlining how the hackathon would be organized.</p>

									<h2>The Day of the Hacktory</h2>
									<p>On Thursday, December 9th, at 18:00, the hackathon began. First, we joined the Discord channel called Hackers Arena. Here, we received more information about what to expect, and the first task was explained. Separate Discord voice channels were created for each group. After the explanation, we could join our own voice channel.</p>
									<span class="image main-small"><img src="images/discord.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>We started working on our first task, brainstorming what our Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) would be. We received a document where we could indicate the SDGs and ask a few questions. Once we were done, we could upload it and move on to the second task. Each time a task was completed, we received an explanation for the next task in the Hackers Arena channel. This continued until the end of the hackathon, with breaks in between, of course. Finally, we were finished. We were ready to record our pitch.</p>

									  </div></span>
									<p>On December 10th, we found out who made it to the finals and who would give a live pitch. Our team, System Zombies, was among the final four, so we made it to the finals. In the end, we didn't quite win, but I'm very happy with our placement in the finals!</p>
									<span class="image main-smaller"><img src="images/FINALIST_11.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>I found it to be a very enjoyable and educational experience. I'm really glad I was able to participate in the hackathon. I learned a lot from it and will definitely continue to do so in the future.</p>
